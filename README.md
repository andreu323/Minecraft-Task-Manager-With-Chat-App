this is my minecraft task manager with chat app backend.

login was based on some minecraft server api that was giving from discord id user's minecraft nickname.

if u want to try to use this app u should  add ur discord id and nickname at spworlds.js (at the line 54)


made on nodejs with socket io. frontend was made on sveltekit.

this app was created at june 2023 and it took me 3 month thats why this code looks trash (and becouse it was my first app).
